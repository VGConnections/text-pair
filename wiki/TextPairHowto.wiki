#summary How to index a corpus, set up a server, and run a query on a Text::Pair collection.

= Introduction =

There are three different modes of use for the Text::Pair object: index, server, and query mode. This document describes how to accomplish each stage.

In order to provide a fast search through a large corpus, Text::Pair creates an index of all "shingles" (sequences of N words) in the corpus. For a corpus many millions of words, this index is likely too large to fit into memory, so it is stored on disk. In order to minimize disk seeks, a Bloom filter (the Bloom::Faster Perl module) is used to 

 During the indexing, several files are created and stored in the {{{data_directory}}}. Documents in the {{{document_queue}}} are read into memory, shingled, and written out to {{{docindex}}} in the {{{data_directory}}}.
  * Shingles are written out to {{{shingles}}}, then sorted by hash value
